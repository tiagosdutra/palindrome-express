## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node, Express

My goal was taking a previous project and using it in an express framework

## Optimizations

I could have made more robust message fields, as well as more stylistic choices.

## Lessons Learned:

Keeping track of what is connected in the main.js and how it is sent over to the database through routes.
